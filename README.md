# Early Algorithmic Art
## 1999, with a revisit in 2009

To make these algorithmis, I wrote computer code
in a variety of languages that printed out a 3D 
markup.  The markup is then fed into a renderer to create the graphics.  I tended to explore simple algorithms and shapes rather than more geometrically complex forms like bezier curves or fractals.  This gives the work a unique look, and reflects an intention, as well as a personal limitation.
